    <h1>Image</h1>

    <!-- here we want to upload a image in our web site -->
    <!-- we do it with <img> tag -->
    <!-- it doesn't have closing tag it just has opening tag -->

    <!-- in "src" we have to write a path of image if it is in our machion.
    in this case if we sent a code to another one or user they can see our image because it is just in our machion not in their machion -->
    <!-- that is better to give image link to when user go in site the image download for them and they will see image -->

    <!-- in "alt" we write a description to in any case if image doesn't load for user , user will understand that what image is -->
    <!-- first I give a image path -->

    <!-- we can also adjust the size of the photo with "width" and "height"-->
    <!-- but it is not good to do this we can change its size in css -->
    <!-- <img src="/home/nima/Downloads/indext2.jpg" alt="image of tree" > -->

    <!-- here I give a link to load for user too -->
